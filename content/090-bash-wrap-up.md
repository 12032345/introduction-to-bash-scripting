# Wrap Up

Congratulations! You have just completed the Bash basics book!

Be sure to bookmark this guide anytime you need to reference any Bash topic in the future.

In this tutorial, we just covered the basics, but you still have enough under your belt to start wringing some awesome scripts and automating daily tasks!

As a next step try writing your own script and share it with the world! This is the best way to learn any new programming or scripting language!

Make sure to tweet about it and tag [@bobbyiliev_](https://twitter.com) so that we could check it out!

Congrats again on completing this tutorial!
